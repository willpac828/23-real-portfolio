          <p class="about"><span class="bright">Hey</span>, my name is Will. You've landed on my About Me page, presumably of
          your own volition. While I have your attention, I'd like to tell you a bit about myself. I was born in
          <span>Atl</span>, but I've called <span class="bright">Nashville</span> home since before Y2K *shudder*.
          I consider myself a lifelong learner; for most of my life I've enjoyed messing around with various spoken languages,
          and at some point I became aware of computer languages.</p>

          <p class="about">Growing up in the South, <span class="bright">"tech"</span> isn't nearly the known and giant entity that it is on the West Coast and in New England.
          Accordingly, for most of my life I took the internet completely for granted. I gradually became conscious of the fact
          that making internet content consisted of countless moving parts, however, and I found myself drawn to learning that sort
          of technology for myself. Nowadays, I'm proud to call myself a <span class="bright">web developer,</span> and I don't plan on switching gears anytime soon. </p>

          <p class="about"> When I'm not reading up on cool CSS transitions or listening to JavaScript podcasts, you can probably find
          me flipping through French or Hungarian flashcards, playing with the most recent Magic the Gathering set, finding the coolest
          patio bars in Nashville, or (most likely) planning my next adventure.</p>
